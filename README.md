# Neural & Language Classification Models

## Description
- Constructed multiple learning models from scratch: a perceptron, neural networks, nonlinear regression, digit classification, and language identification
- Implemented forward and backward propagation, experimented with different architectures, and handled batching and regularization
- Learned how high-level ML methods translate into code and how architecture choices affect learning outcomes

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Git
- GitHub
